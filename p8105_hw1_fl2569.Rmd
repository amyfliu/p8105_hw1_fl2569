### Problem 1

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce coercion; it is important to know how R treats numeric, character, and factor variables.

First, load in the required tidyverse library.
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then, create the data frame containing the specified variables. 
```{r df_create}
set.seed(1234)

q1_dataframe <- tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_character = c("hello","my", "name", "is", "Amy", "how", "are", "you", "doing", "today"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Small", "Medium", "Large", "Small", "Medium", "Large","Small", "Small", "Medium", "Large"))
)
```
